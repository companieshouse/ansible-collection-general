# Ansible Collection - companieshouse.general

An [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/) collection comprising general Ansible roles and playbooks for use in [Companies House](https://github.com/companieshouse) projects.

## Collection Metadata

The metadata file `galaxy.yml` for this collection is generated dynamically from a Jinja2 template stored in the `templates` directory during CI/CD builds using the [build-ansible-collection](https://github.com/companieshouse/ci-concourse-resources/tree/master/tasks/provisioning/ansible-2.15.7/build-ansible-collection) task. The version number generated by the [calculate-new-version](https://github.com/companieshouse/ci-concourse-resources/blob/build-ansible-collections/tasks/release/calculate-new-version/task.yml) task in a pipeline is injected into the populated `galaxy.xml` file and added to the build artefact generated by the [build-ansible-collection](https://github.com/companieshouse/ci-concourse-resources/tree/master/tasks/provisioning/ansible-2.15.7/build-ansible-collection) task.

> [!NOTE]
> The `.gitignore` file includes an entry for the `galaxy.yml` metadata file to avoid accidental inclusion of this file. All changes should be made to the `templates/galaxy.yml.j2` template file instead.
